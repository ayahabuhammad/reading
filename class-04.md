## HTML Links - Hyperlinks 

HTML links are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another document. When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand. Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!

    Links are created using the <a> element

    <a href="http://www.google.com">Link</a>

     The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to

You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

# HTML Layout

It is important to have a systematic and aesthetic organization of the elements in an HTML web-page. It makes the web-page better and provides an overall visual appeal to the users. 


* here are four different techniques to create multi-column layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:


    - CSS framework
    - CSS float property
    - CSS flexbox
    - CSS grid

\<div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

X Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

X The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts 
(Floated items require a defined width.)

X Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts

# Functions, Methods, and Objects: 

## function 
 part of a program that has its own name. This name can be used in the program as a command (this command is called a function call). When a function is called, the commands of which it consists are executed. A function call can return a value (similar to an operation) and therefore can be used in an expression along with operations.

 # Calling the function 
 To run the code in the function we use the function name followed by parentheses 

        userName();


Sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task. In such cases, when you declare the function you give it _**parameters**_ . Inside the function, the parameters act like variables.

       function getArea (width, height)
           {
                 return width * height;
           }

       we run this by calling the fun with Var:
             getArea(3,5);
