# JavaScript
is a programming language commonly used in web development, It Can Change HTML Content , value and Change HTML Styles (CSS). 

### _JavaScript_ 
 is easy to learn and  We use  **JavaScript** to program the behavior of web pages and to make interact .

## Expression 
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 

An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.

The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to seven.

The code 3 + 4 is an example of the second expression type. This expression uses the + operator to add three and four together without assigning the result, seven, to a variable.


-------
## Operation ##

 operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result


### JavaScript has expression categoriesM like :

    - arithmetic operators
    - Logical operators

 you should be careful when you write in Javascript :

    1-  It is case sensitive .
    2- statements must end with semicolon .
