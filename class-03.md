HTML lists are used to present list of information in well formed and semantic way. 

There are three different types of list in HTML and each one has a specific purpose and meaning:


     - Unordered list :
      Used to create a list of related items, in no particular order.

     - Ordered list :
     Used to create a list of related items, in a specific order.

     - Description list :
     Used to create a list of terms and their descriptions.


### *Note* 
ou can also use the type attribute to change the numbering type e.g. type="I". However, you should avoid this attribute, use the CSS list-style-type property instead.

 A text box is a rectangular area on the screen where you can enter text. It is a common user interface element found in many types of software programs, such as web browsers, email clients, and word processors. When you click in a text box, a flashing cursor is displayed, indicating you can begin typing. If you are using a tablet, tapping inside a text box may automatically display the on-screen keyboard.

There are two different types of text boxes:

    — text field is small box that allows you to enter a single line of text. It is used for entering basic values, such as a name, number, or short phrase.


    - text area is a larger box that allows you to enter multiple lines of text. Generally, pressing Enter in a text area will enter a newline character, creating a line break.

array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we want to store list of elements and access them by a single variable. Unlike most languages where array is a reference to the multiple variable, in JavaScript array is a single variable that stores multiple elements.

These are some important rules of the Java switch case:

    -There is no limit for the number of cases in a switch statement.

    -There can be one or ‘N’ number of cases in a switch statement.

    -The case values should be unique and can’t be duplicated. 

    -If there is a duplicate value, then it is a compilation error.

    -The data type of the values for a case must be the same as the data type of the variable in the switch test expression.
