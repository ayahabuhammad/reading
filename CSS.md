# Introducing CSS
## CSS ##
   stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

   CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen .

A CSS rule contains two parts:

    1- selector : indicate which element the rule applies 

    2- declaration : indicate how the elements should be styled. 


Declarations are made up of two parts: 

      the properties : of the element that you want to change
       the values :  of those properties

# Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

    - External CSS :
     defined within the <link> element
      ex -> <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"> .

     - Internal CSS : defined within the <style> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML .

     - Inline CSS :
     defined within the "style" attribute of the relevant element 
     ex -> <p style="color:red;">
