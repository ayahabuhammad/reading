# operators

# Comparison operators:

operators that compare values and return true or false. The operators include:

      >, <, >=, <=, ===, and !== 

You may be familiar with **comparison operators** from math class :

      - Less than (<) 
      - Greater than (>) 
      - Less than or equal to (<=) 
      - Greater than or equal to (>=)
      - Equal to (===) 
      - Not equal to (!==) 



# Logical operators
Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

      - And &&
      - Or || 
      - Not !



# Looping 

  _**Loops**_ 
  are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false.

## The three most common types of loops are: ##

- ## For ##
       Syntax:
        for ([initialization]); [condition]; [final-expression])
         {
            // statement
         }

- ## While ##
       Syntax:
       while (condition)
       {
          statement(s);
       }
    
- ## Do while ##
        Syntax:
         do 
         {
           *Statement(s);*
         }  
         while (*condition*);
