# IMAGES IN  HTML
Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.


The HTML \<img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page. 

The \<img> tag has two required attributes:

     - src : Specifies the path to the image
     - alt : Specifies an alternate text for the image 

- You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.

- You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format

# Color 

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

 ## RGB Value

  In CSS, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:
       rgb(red, green, blue)

  Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.

  For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

   To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).

   To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).


 ## HEX Value
   In CSS, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:
      
          #rrggbb

  Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).

   For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).
