# Functions 

 Set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value , _function_ like a container that contain many statements together to do a specific task. 

# Declare a function 
 To declare a function we give it a name and then write the statements inside the  curly braces.

     " function body = statement "

# Calling the function 
 To run the code in the function we use the function name followed by parentheses 

        greetWorld();


 Sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task. In such cases, when you declare the function you give it _**parameters**_ . Inside the function, the parameters act like variables.

       function getArea (width, height)
           {
                 return width * height;
           }

       we run this by calling the fun with Var:
             getArea(3,5);
