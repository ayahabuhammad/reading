It is important to have a systematic and aesthetic organization of the elements in an HTML web-page. It makes the web-page better and provides an overall visual appeal to the users. 


* here are four different techniques to create multi-column layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:


    - CSS framework
    - CSS float property
    - CSS flexbox
    - CSS grid

\<div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts 
(Floated items require a defined width.)

* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts

* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## Creating Multi-Column Layouts with Floats:
-The following three CSS properties are used to position the columns next to each other:
  - width : This sets the width of the columns.
  - float : This positions the columns next to each other.
  - margin : This creates a gap between the
  columns.
  
  
##  Screen Resolution 

Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

## Page Sizes

Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

## Fixed Width Layouts
Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.

## Advantages
     ● Pixel values are accurate at controlling size and positioning of elements.

     ● The designer has far greater control over the appearance and position of items on the page than with liquid layouts.

     ● You can control the lengths of lines of text regardless of the size of the user's window.
     
     ● The size of an image will always remain the same relative to the rest of the page.


## Disadvantages

     ● You can end up with big gaps around the edge of a page.

     ● If the user's screen is a much higher resolution than the
      designer's screen, the page can look smaller and text can be harder to read.

     ● If a user increases font sizes, text might not fit into the
     allotted spaces.

     ● The design works best on devices that have a site or resolution similar to that of desktop or laptop computers.

     ● The page will often take up more vertical space than a liquid layout with the same content.
