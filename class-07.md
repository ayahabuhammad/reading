# Domain Modeling

_Domain modeling_ is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

* The idea of using domain modeling in conjunction with web front-end design has been explored by a few web design methods proposed in the research community.

*  These methods have underlined the differences between data modeling for traditional applications and for hypertext-based interfaces. 

# HTML TABLES 
The HTML tables allow web authors to arrange data like text, images, links, other tables, etc. into rows and columns of cells. The HTML tables are created using the \<table> tag in which the \<tr> tag is used to create table rows and \<td> tag is used to create data cells. The elements under \<td> are regular and left aligned by default.

* The \<table> element is used to add tables to a web page.
* A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the \<tr> element.
* Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the \<td> element (or \<th> if it is a
header).
* You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
* For long tables you can split the table into a \<thead>,
\<tbody>, and \<tfoot>.

# Functions, Methods, and Objects

* Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
* Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value.
* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object. 


# method
 is a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation. When you call the System.out.println() method, for example, the system actually executes several statements in order to display a message on the console.

Now you will learn how to create your own methods with or without return values, invoke a method with or without parameters, and apply method abstraction in the program design.
