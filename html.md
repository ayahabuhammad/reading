**HTML**  (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

# HTML5 
HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. 

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up theparts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of contentyou will find in them.
 
 HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as 

     <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>,      <footer>,<article>, <section>, <p>, 
     <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.

   # CSS

   Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

   With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

   CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

  # Using CSS

  CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

    -Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
    -Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section.
    -External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.

  The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
